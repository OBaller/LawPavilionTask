# LawPavilionTask
The goal is to create a simple iOS application which makes a request to an API, parses the response, and displays the result in the UI. The app will consist of three main components: 1. A search component that will have: a. A TextView input for entering a String value b. A ‘Search’ Button to initiate a request to: https://api.github.com/search/users?q={searchQuery}, where {searchQuery} is the TextView input value  2. A results component for displaying the results of the user search. The result response must have the following nodes: a. login b. avatar_url c. Type Use pagination and display 10 items per_page. The results must be sorted alphabetically by ‘login’. Please reference the Github docs: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search#search-users 3. A detail component that is presented when a result item is tapped on  The user interface should appear modern and simple while following best practices around iOS UI. Creativity is encouraged, so feel free design the UI in any way you wish. However, the app must be functionally complete.
